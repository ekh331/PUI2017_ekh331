The Null and Alternative hypothesis:
Ho = Subscriber trip duration >= Customer trip duration
Ha = Subscriber trip duration < Customer trip duration

This Citibike analysis can be statistically tested with the "correlation test" because the independent 
variable is categorical (subscriber or customer) and how does it impact the dependent variable (trip duration). 
This test can be a method for Citibike to target marketting to customers that have longer trip 
durations that generate more revenue.

A potential analysis on the original question on subscriber vs. customer trip duration could be locating the two types of riders and look for densities of location that perhaps can be related to usage of residents and tourists and see if duration fits the users location and explore duration from that perspective.
