The Null and Alternative hypothesis:
Ho = Subscriber trip duration >= Customer trip duration
Ha = Subscriber trip duration < Customer trip duration

This Citibike analysis can be statistically tested with the "correlation test" because the independent 
variable is categorical (subscriber or customer) and how does it impact the dependent variable (trip duration). 
This test cab be a method for Citibike to target marketting to customers that have longer trip 
durations that generate more revenue.
