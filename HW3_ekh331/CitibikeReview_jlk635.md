## Author: Jon Kastelan


## Need to assume Customers notation is (T), and Subscribers notation is (S)
## If notation is correct (which it appears to be), the null and alternative hypotheses are correctly stated. 
## Significance level is appropriately stated

## Analysis is interested in whether Customers are more likely to have longer bike trips than Subscribers

## The relevant data is extracted, tripduration and usertype. Data is summarised appropriately and 
## relevant plot made of the two averages

An appropriate test would be the t-test for difference in means, with the assumption that trip times in the 
two samples follow a normal/t-distribution (i.e. they are parametric and follow a distribution).

## This is a good question to be asking.
