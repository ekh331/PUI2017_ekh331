## Part 2: Due after Thanksgiving
<p>
This assignment was an exercise in geopandas and US census data. Data were acquired of PUMA regions and merged with
data concerning the LinkNYC free Internet stations around the city. Through processing and merging of multiple
dataframes, maps were created detailing the extent of household broadband Internet access across the city in addition
to the geographic distribution and density of LinkNYC stations.
