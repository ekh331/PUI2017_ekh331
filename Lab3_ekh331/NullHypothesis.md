# Null hypothesis in-class work
<p>
### Formulate the Null hypothesis in words and in formulae for the 4 experiments below:

**Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?**

Experimental setup: you have a test and a control sample.

<b>Null Hypothesis</b>:On average, the change in body fat percentage of the test sample, which diets and exercises, 
is greater or equal than the bfp of the control sample, which only exercises.
<br> B<sub>t</sub> >= B<sub>c</sub>

**Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.** (Olds et al., 1994, p. 223)

Experimemtal setup: measure IQ of children of smokers and non-smokers at age 1, 2, 3, and 4 years.

<p>
<b>Null Hypothesis</b>: On average, the IQ of children of smokers is on statistically indistinguishable from to the IQ
of children of nonsmokers.
<br> I<sub>s</sub> >= I<sub>n</sub>


**Food deserts contribute to the incidence of diabetes** 
Food deserts are defined as parts of the country vapid of fresh fruit, vegetables, and other healthful whole foods, usually found in impoverished areas. This is largely due to a lack of grocery stores, farmers' markets, and healthy food providers.

This is not a lab experiment, but you have data on the incidence of diabetes for the US population.
<p>

<b>Null Hypothesis</b>: On average, diabetic prevalence not spatially correlated with food deserts.
<br> P<sub>d</sub> != P<sub>f</sub>
