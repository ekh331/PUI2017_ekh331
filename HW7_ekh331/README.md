# Homework 7

### This homework was completed indivudally.

## Assignment 1

For this assignment, our hypothesis testing suggested by a peer for Homework 3 part 2 was considered, 
and the Citi Bike statistical testing for the proposed idea was carried out.<br>
I used a peer review by my classmate Jon (jlk635), which can be found here: https://github.com/ekh331/PUI2017_ekh331/blob/297706d184d5a3e31829f8c16fe16a172dd136c4/HW3_ekh331/CitibikeReview_jlk635.md

<p>
I wrote a brief report on the project testing on Authorea, a pdf of which is included in this directory.
The link to the paper on Authorea itself is here: https://www.authorea.com/users/175909/articles/211800-analysis-of-citi-bike-user-type-and-average-trip-duration

## Assignment 2

This assignment is a SQL-based lab to perform SQL queries as learned in Professor Vo's guest lecture. It 
queries a Citi Bike dataset and performs certain basic functions, such as sorting trips in descending trip time, and
culminates with finding the station with the longest average trip duration on the weekend within 500 meters of 
Times Square. The extra credit assignment of making the notebook compatible with both Python 2 and 3 was accomplished by properly managing the imports respective to each version.
