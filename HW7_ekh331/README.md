# Homework 7

### This homework was completed indivudally.

## Assignment 1

For this assignment, our hypothesis testing suggested by a peer for Homework 3 part 2 was considered, 
and the Citi Bike statistical testing for the proposed idea was carried out.<br>
I used a peer review by my classmate Jon (jlk635), which can be found here: https://github.com/ekh331/PUI2017_ekh331/blob/297706d184d5a3e31829f8c16fe16a172dd136c4/HW3_ekh331/CitibikeReview_jlk635.md

<p>
I wrote a brief report on the project testing on Authorea, a pdf of which is included in this directory.
The link to the paper on Authorea itself is here: https://www.authorea.com/users/175909/articles/211800-analysis-of-citi-bike-user-type-and-average-trip-duration
