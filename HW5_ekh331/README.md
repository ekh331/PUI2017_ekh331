## Assignment 1

In this assignment, a poisson distribution was chosen and compared to a Gaussian distribution by using the Anderson-Darling test. The critical value calculated for the declared significance level of alpha = 0.05 was less than the A-D statistic. The null hypothesis that the poisson distribution is of a specific form (Gaussian) could not be rejected. 

## Assignment 2

In this assignment, four statistical tests were performed to measure the degree to which the poisson and the binomial distributions resemble a Gaussian distribution when n becomes sufficiently large. The four tests performed were KS, KL, A-D, and Pearson's chi squared. It was found that as n increases, the more the poisson and binomial distributions appear normal. Sampling error prevents the p-values from dropping to zero.

## Assignment 3

In this assignment, many different ways of plotting and discovering outliers and confidence intervals were explored with gun ownership and GDP data for a collection of countries around the world. The United States was often found to be an outlier, with both a high GDP and a high amount of all kinds of firearm activity.
