# Homework 4

Aside from group work required for assignment 2, this homework was completed individually. Partners for part 2 were Jon Kastelan and Andrew Nell. 

## Assignment 1

I reviewed the Homework 3 part 2 of a classmate. I consulted the flowchart used in the slides for PUI session 4 to choose a statistical test. The markdown file with the review can be found at https://github.com/ekh331/PUI2017_ekh331/blob/master/HW4_ekh331/CitibikeReview_ekh331.md 
or in the pull request to the original student's repository.

## Assignment 2

### I worked together with Jon Kastelan and Andrew Nell on this part of the homework.
